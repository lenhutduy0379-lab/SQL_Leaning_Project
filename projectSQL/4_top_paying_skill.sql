    /*
     -High pay = hybrid roles, not pure analysts → Many top-paying skills (Kafka, Terraform, PyTorch) belong to data engineering or ML workflows,
     meaning these jobs expect you to go beyond dashboards into building pipelines or models
     -AI + Data Engineering are the biggest multipliers → Skills like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Airflow, Kafka 
     increase salary because they are used in production systems (real-time data, ML deployment), not just analysis
     -Rarity > popularity → These skills pay more because fewer people have them and they’re harder to master,
     often tied to complex, business-critical systems, so companies pay a premium
